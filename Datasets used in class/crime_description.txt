The crime.csv data set appears in Statistical Methods for Social Sciences, Third Edition by Alan Agresti and Barbara 
Finlay (Prentice Hall, 1997).  The variables are state id (sid), state name (state), violent crimes per 100,000 
people (crime), murders per 1,000,000 (murder),  the percent of the population living in metropolitan areas (pctmetro), 
the percent of the population that is white (pctwhite), percent of population with a high school education or above (pcths), 
percent of population living under poverty line (poverty), and percent of population that are single parents (single).  
Before you perform any analysis, drop the observation for Washington, D.C. (sid=51) because it is not a state. The goal of 
the analysis is to fit a multiple linear regression model by regressing the crime rate on the percent of population living 
under poverty line (poverty) and percent of population that are single parents (single).
